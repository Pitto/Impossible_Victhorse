"It is practically impossible to teach
good programming to students that have
had a prior exposure to BASIC:
as potential programmers they are
mentally mutilated
beyond hope of regeneration."

Edsger Dijkstra
Victor is a Freebasic programmer,
he has a happy life
in the Country of Codingland.

But Darkistra, an evil Dijkstra pupil,
takes power over Codingland...

...suddenly Freebasic is outlawed!
The keywords of the language
are banned, removed, and hidden
into cryptographaded mainframes.

Only a person may find
and free all these keywords,
only a person may rehabilitate
the forbidden language...

...The Freebasic programming
language creator himself!

Having only a couple of floppies,
the Victor's journey begins...
